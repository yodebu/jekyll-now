11th of April, morning 10 am I started towards my office, reached office after roaming around the place for around 20 -30 mins. I was lost. When i reached the office, i was greeted by Ann, Manisha, Aratrika. Soon another Pagdi-wale Sardarji joined me in his sehma sehma sa look. We waited for Omair and Binny to come. 

SLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPP :D !!!
