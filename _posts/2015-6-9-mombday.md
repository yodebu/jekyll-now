<br><br>
 *I was sitting alone in the Office, past memories of my Special Girl were coming along...so started writing... Summed up many things in a single post!*
<br> 

<br><br><br><br>

**STORY OF A BEATING HEART**

Is a Beating Heart, the only requisite for considering a man alive? <br>
Even a broken heart beats,
but the man isn't alive any more. <br>
He is just another DEAD MAN walking... <br> <br>


<br><br><br><br>


**HOW I CHASED YOU**

Like a dog chasing a car,<br>
I chase you from afar,<br>
Knowing I can never catch up,<br>
And even if I do, so what?<br>
What can a dog possibly do with a car?<br>
Poor bastard can just look at it from afar.... :( <br><br>

<br><br><br><br>


**TRUE REASON OF MY HAPPINESS**


My happiness used to depend on you and the things you did. <br>
An empty mind is the devil's workshop and Lord knows the devil did tempt me whenever I was alone, corrupting my thoughts with tales of your infidelity. <br>
I couldn't confront you anymore like the old days, so I believed that bastard. <br>
 But a life without hope is worse than one filled with despair. And I read somewhere that one shouldn't depend on another for happiness.<br>
I don't. <br>
Not anymore. <br>
You still make me happy whenever you wish to. <br>
So do other things, but whenever your face comes to haunt me my happiness, whatever little I have, fades away and I end up on melancholy hill pondering about the things you said and the things you did.<br>
Has nothing changed then?<br>
Well,not quite. <br>
I don't depend on you for my happiness anymore. <br>
However the fact rests that nothing else quite does it for me. <br>
I desire you but your love is a necessity for me. <br>
So, I lie to myself that you love me. And I am getting better at it with every passing day.<br>
*So you see my love, my happiness doesn't depend on you anymore, it simply rests on my ability to lie to myself.*<br><br>


<br><br><br><br>

**AFTER YOU LOSE HER**


You have it and then you lose it.<br>
After you have lost it all you can do is ponder over the time when you had it and if you are optimistic even hope you have it again.<br> 
But you won't. <br>
*Time brings you things and time takes them away.*<br>
You are helpless. <br>
Just a mere cog that is irreplaceable.<br><br>


<br><br><br><br>
**I MISS YOU, PLEASE COME BACK**


In retrospect, I had an epiphany. Nothing surprising, really. I just realised what a damn fool I was.<BR>
Ever since I remember, I was chasing after you. I might have wandered off here and there at times but I was always right behind you. Eventually, I even manage to catch up to you.<br>
And what did I do when I had you all to myself?<br>
*I locked you in a prison of sorts, didn't I?*<br>
But that was never my intention, my love. <br>
For what you saw as a prison, was indeed a shrine that I built. The walls I raised around you were not to take away your freedom, simply to deny anyone else the opportunity to revere you. It was greed or maybe fear that made me raise those walls so high. In my frenzy,I transgressed. I never realised when my devotion turned to suffocation for you.<br>
Now you are out. On the way out you knocked down a couple of walls, but the shrine still exists held together by memories. The goddess may not reside there any longer but this devotee would spend his life inside there. Waiting, even in vain for a chance to revere you again.<br>
But,I will not follow you anymore.<br>
*Now you can make your own way and I do hope you enjoy the freedom you craved so bad.*<br>
**The transgression was not my foolishness, for it was bound to happen when mortal falls for a celestial being. The foolish thing was to assume that the celestial being could ever love a mortal.**<br><br>
